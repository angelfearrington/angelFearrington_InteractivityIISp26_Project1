   <h1>How The Internet Opened My Eyes</h1>
   <br>
   <p>On this website I want to share my experience with the internet and how the internet had made me more aware of what is happening in my society, country, and globally. We are living through history right now, in a very tumultuous time that feels so hopeless at times. Here I want to share the content I view that helps me stay conscious and aware of the world around me, as well as the broader world. I also want to show how I use the internet to escape from these topics when they get a little too heavy to bear.</p>
