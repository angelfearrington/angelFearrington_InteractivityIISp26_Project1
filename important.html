    <b>WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT</b>
    </div> 
    <br> 
     <p>I know that a lot of people struggle to keep up with the news for various reasons.</p>
   <br>
   <div id="ReasonsList">
   <b>A List of Commonly Stated Reasons:</b>
  <ol>
   <li>Being too busy in your own daily life</li>
   <br>
   <li>The news is too depressing and heavy to pay attention to</li>
   <br>
   <li>Things constantly happening all over the world making it too difficult to keep up</li>
   <br>
   <li>Believing that these things do not effect you</li>
  </ol>

<p>Overall, all of these statements can be very true in their own rights. However, even though the news might seem like its too much to handle, it is still very important to at least try to be aware of what is happening that may be affecting your friends, family, neighbors, and community members, as well as in other cultures and societies.
  <br>
  <br>
  I mention on the <i>What Content I View</i> page that some of the news topics and content is really heavy and graphic for certain audiences. So, even though I believe that it is every person's duty to be and stay aware of what is happening in our global communities, I understand if it can be too much for some. If this is the case, I think it is a good idea to gain knowledge of the topic through another medium. One other medium I consume the news through besides Youtube and TikTok is Twitter (currently X). And sometimes this way is safer for senstive audiences and viewer discretion.
